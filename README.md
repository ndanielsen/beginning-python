# So You're Learning Python...

### HISTORY OF PYTHON?

* Created by Guido Von Rossum in 1991
* Currently on version 3+ but most people still use 2.7+
* Influenced by:
* C, C++, Dylan, Haskell, Java, Icon, Lisp, Perl, ABC, ALGOL, Modula-3

About the origin of Python, Van Rossum wrote in 1996: 
    
    Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).

#### Core Philosopy ("PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)")

    Beautiful is better than ugly
    Explicit is better than implicit
    Simple is better than complex
    Complex is better than complicated
    Readability counts
