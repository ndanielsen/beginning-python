# Post-Class Notes

Hi all,

Great class. Send your hw code for a review via email or a gist on github. I will do a free code review and send you the answer code.

Also I will be doing a free public class at the MLK library on December 5th at the [dcpython pylab](http://www.meetup.com/DCPython/events/225514354/). I'll probably go through the answers to this dataset and beyond. =)

For next continuing on your python journey, I recommend getting involved
in the python community. 

Also great free online books for continuing your building your skills:

[Learn Python the Hardway](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) 
A classic that many have used, but also a little snarky (if you like that)

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html)
An equally good book and allows you to use python right in your browser. 

[Learn Python](http://www.learnpython.org/)
This website is intended for everyone who wishes to learn the Python programming language.

[Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python)
Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.

[Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
More advanced but fantastic, it includes hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).

[A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182)
Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.

[DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/)
Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.





# Pre-Class Notes

Hi all,

I'm looking forward to teaching everyone. 

Prior to class, please follow the instructions below. Feel free to email me if you have any questions: nathan.danielsen [&t] gmail.com

To allow us to quickly get in the class material, I ask that everyone come with python, a text editor installed and can run 'hello world.'

If you don't have python installed, I recommend that you install
Anaconda. This is a free, powerful analytics package that comes with
python and the text editor Spyder that is well suited for data analysis and is used extensively in GA's Data Science course. We will be using python 2.7 in this class because the Data Science course is still using 2.7

Download here:

I will be using Spyder (text editor) in class, so it is strongly
recommended that you do also. Please try to run the 'hello
world' program in Spyder before class. The video below will help you to navigate spyder and run 'hello world.'

[Python With Spyder 1: First Steps (Updated 7/24/2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5GevIHNctM)

For more advanced folks, feel free to user whatever you wish.

Looking forward to seeing everyone in class!
