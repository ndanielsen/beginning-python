# Pre-Class Notes

Hi all,

I'm looking forward to teaching everyone. 

Prior to class, please follow the instructions below. Feel free to email me if you have any questions: nathan.danielsen [&t] gmail.com

To allow us to quickly get in the class material, I ask that everyone come with python, a text editor installed and can run 'hello world.'

If you don't have python installed, I recommend that you install
Anaconda. This is a free, powerful analytics package that comes with
python and the text editor Spyder that is well suited for data analysis and is used extensively in GA's Data Science course. We will be using python 2.7 in this class because the Data Science course is still using 2.7

I will be using Spyder (text editor) in class, so it is strongly
recommended that you do also. Please try to run the 'hello
world' program in Spyder before class. The video below will help you to navigate spyder and run 'hello world.'

For more advanced folks, feel free to user whatever you wish.

Looking forward to seeing everyone in class!
