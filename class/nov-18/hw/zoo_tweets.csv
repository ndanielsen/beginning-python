2953|Wed Sep 05 17:09:51 +0000 2012|@kat_b87 Not yet! We should know by mid-Sept. Today we are just prepping in the case that she were to have a cub but reject it! #cubwatch
2954|Wed Sep 05 17:02:29 +0000 2012|Panda House is closed to give Mei peace and quiet, but send in your #cubwatch questions until 2 p.m. (EST)! http://t.co/5kFiXJAo
2955|Wed Sep 05 17:00:53 +0000 2012|And here's Mei as our team painstakingly practices and plans behind the scenes to possibly care for a cub. #cubwatch http://t.co/SIX0ec1u
2956|Wed Sep 05 16:54:17 +0000 2012|But ideally, if we have a cub, Mei would once again be a terrific mother. #cubwatch
2957|Wed Sep 05 16:53:25 +0000 2012|Despite giving up sleep, there'd be plenty of staff volunteering to help raise a panda cub! #cubwatch
2958|Wed Sep 05 16:52:23 +0000 2012|Everyone's lined up to practice making the formula. #cubwatch http://t.co/HUubeSQs
2959|Wed Sep 05 16:50:26 +0000 2012|And the cub could nurse for up to 30 minutes, which means the keepers wouldn't get much sleep! #cubwatch
2960|Wed Sep 05 16:49:40 +0000 2012|Hand rearing a panda would be MORE than a full-time job. The cub would have to be fed every two hours for the first month. #cubwatch
2961|Wed Sep 05 16:48:48 +0000 2012|Each day the keepers, vets and nutritionists would work together on a daily basis to take care of the cub. #cubwatch
2962|Wed Sep 05 16:45:58 +0000 2012|So today the team is practicing mixing the formula! #cubwatch http://t.co/sZT7OXx6
2963|Wed Sep 05 16:45:18 +0000 2012|Some of the products we use are the things human moms feed their babies--and lots of mixing formula in the middle of the night. #cubwatch
2964|Wed Sep 05 16:43:22 +0000 2012|There's a special team of individuals on standby ready to hand raise a cub if we need to. #cubwatch
2965|Wed Sep 05 16:42:35 +0000 2012|If we had to hand raise a cub, it would need hourly care and bottle feeding with a very specific formula. #cubwatch
2966|Wed Sep 05 16:40:30 +0000 2012|If Mei were to have twins, she might not care for both cubs, so we also prep to rotate cubs between hand raising and Mei. #cubwatch
2967|Wed Sep 05 16:39:25 +0000 2012|Mei was a great mother to Tai Shan in 2005, so she probably wouldn't reject a cub. But we prep for all scenarios. #cubwatch
2968|Wed Sep 05 16:36:39 +0000 2012|If Mei rejected a cub, the keepers would raise it with ongoing attempts to reunite her with the cub. #cubwatch
2969|Wed Sep 05 16:35:12 +0000 2012|During today's session, keepers, vets and nutritionists are on hand to learn how to care for a cub if Mei were to reject it. #cubwatch
