# After class notes

Hi all,

It was a great class and it was my pleasure to teach you. 

I've uploaded the solutions to the class exercises in the code. 

As a bonus material, I've added an exercise in the HW folder. The exercise is a synthesis of all the areas that we covered in class, and adds a few additional twists and turns. It is a basic recreation of a famous post called "Using Python to see how the Times writes about men and women."

Wish the best of luck to all of you and feel free to send me any questions.
